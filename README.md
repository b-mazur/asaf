# Quick and easy analysis of the data from the flat histogram simulations

***ASAF** (Adsorption Simulation Analysis Facilitator)* is a python library created to facilitate the processing and
analysis of data from grand canonical transition matrix Monte Carlo adsorption simulations.

### Features:

- calculation of the macrostate probability distribution (MPC) from the transition probabilities
- interpolation of the transition probabilities
- calculation of the adsorption isotherm from the MPD
- calculation of the free energy from the MPD
- temperature extrapolation of the macrostate probability distribution
- saving the isotherms to an AIF file

### Download

To download simply type in your terminal `pip install git+https://github.com/b-mazur/asaf.git`

### FAQ

**In my prob files I see `current_cycle` column instead of `macrostate`.**

That's because you're looking at a prob file for a simulation in a particular macrostate. To calculate the macrostate
probability distribution you need at least several simulations in different macrostates. The diagram below explains the
scheme for creating the prob file used by ASAF from prob files generated by RASPA.

**I don't have `.metadata.json` file.**

Currently, the only options are to create this file manually (for example, by copying one of the
[example files](https://github.com/b-mazur/asaf/blob/main/example/data/prob_MOF-303-E4D4_3.2.3_298.000000_1700.metadata.json)
and modifying it) or to add a function to your workflow that generates such a file based on RASPA input files. In the
future,
ASAF will be able to do this.

**Prob files are not generated.**

Make sure that you are using modified version of RASPA.

**My prob files are huge**

In general you can play with `PrintGhostProbabilitesEvery` parameter. A more frequent print will be useful when you want
to use energy fluctuations to extrapolate MPD, otherwise a value similar to that used in `PrintEvery` will be sufficient
to monitor the simulation.
