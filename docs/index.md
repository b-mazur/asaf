# Quick and easy analysis of the data from the flat histogram simulations

***ASAF** (Adsorption Simulation Analysis Facilitator)* is a python library created to facilitate the processing and
analysis of data from grand canonical transition matrix Monte Carlo adsorption simulations.

### Features:

- calculation of the macrostate probability distribution (MPC) from the transition probabilities
- interpolation of the transition probabilities
- calculation of the adsorption isotherm from the MPD
- calculation of the free energy from the MPD
- temperature extrapolation of the macrostate probability distribution
- saving the isotherms to an AIF file
